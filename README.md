# 👋 Hi, I’m Ashish Vora  
### Unity Game Developer | Gameplay Systems | Performance & Architecture

🎮 Unity developer with **3+ years of professional experience**, focused on building **scalable gameplay systems**, clean architecture, and performance-optimized games.  
I specialize in **Unity (C#)** with a strong mindset around **events, state machines, profiling, and optimization**.

I don’t just make things work — I design systems that **scale, perform, and are easy to maintain**.

## 🧠 Core Skills

**Unity Engine**
- AR/VR
- Unity 3D
- Unity 2D
- Photon, Scoket.io, Net-Code
- OpenCV (Object Detection)

**Gameplay & Architecture**
- Event-driven architecture (Actions / Delegates / C# events)
- State machines (enum & class-based)
- Decoupled systems design
- Input → Decision → Action flow

**Performance & Optimization**
- Unity Profiler (CPU / GC / Frame Time)
- Object pooling
- Update loop optimization
- Mobile performance best practices

**Data & Structure**
- ScriptableObject (configuration vs runtime separation)
- Clean project structure
- Avoiding GameManager anti-patterns

**Tools**
- Git / GitHub
- Unity Profiler
- Rider / Visual Studio

## 💼 Professional Experience

### 🎮 Unity Game Developer  
**3+ Years Industry Experience**

- Developed and shipped multiple Unity projects (2D / mobile / gameplay-focused/ Multiplayer)
- Designed **modular gameplay systems** instead of monolithic scripts
- Refactored Update-heavy logic into **event-driven workflows**
- Diagnosed and fixed performance issues using **Unity Profiler**
- Implemented **object pooling** to eliminate GC spikes
- Collaborated with designers and artists to deliver polished gameplay

> I actively focus on *why* a system is built a certain way, not just *how* to build it.
